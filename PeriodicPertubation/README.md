# Periodic Pertubation

A replication of the Kang, Heeger, and Blake (2009) paper in which they first demonstrate the periodic pertubation paradigm. Experiment 3 from this paper is being replicated. In this experiment two rectangular gratings are show on two monitors (One stim per monitor).
The gratings rival due to differences in orientation. Participants must respond to which grating they see in a centeral monitoring region (Left arrow for grating at -45degree angle, Right for anything else). 
Triggers (contrast increments at one pole of stimuli) are presented in antiphase at a trigger rate defined by the participants average stimulus switch rate when free viewing rivaling stimuli.

This script requires DominanceDuration.py (found in ../DominanceDuration) to be ran before this as it genearates a required file for each participant.
